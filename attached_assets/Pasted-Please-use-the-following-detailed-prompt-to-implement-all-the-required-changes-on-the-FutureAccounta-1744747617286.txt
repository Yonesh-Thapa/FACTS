Please use the following detailed prompt to implement all the required changes on the FutureAccountants.com.au website:
Content Updates – Pages and Text:
Homepage:
Replace the hero section’s illustration (classroom_accounting.svg) with a royalty-free image of a real accounting training scenario. Ensure the new image is responsive and has appropriate alt text (e.g., “Accounting students in a training session”).
Embed the TikTok video from Darshan Kumar Thapa on the homepage. Use TikTok’s official embed code (blockquote or iframe) and set it to autoplay (muted). Place this video embed in the “Meet Your Mentor” section, right below or next to Darshan’s bio text, so that it complements the introduction. Ensure the video player is sized well for desktop and mobile (e.g., a width of 100% of its container).
Update the “Why Choose F.A.C.T.S” or highlights section: replace “Value-Added Path” text to “Future-Proof Skills (AI & Cybersecurity)”. Rewrite the blurb to: “As part of our commitment to future-proofing your skills, we include an introduction to AI tools and cybersecurity basics within the program, making you more competitive in the modern job market.” (This removes the word “optional”).
Add a new section on the homepage for Testimonials. For now, include 2 sample testimonials in quote format (we can use fictional or anonymized quotes if real ones are not available yet). For example:
“The F.A.C.T.S training was exactly what I needed. I landed an accounting job within a month of finishing the program!” – A. Singh, Graduate.
Use a styled blockquote or a carousel for testimonials, and include a placeholder silhouette or stock photo of a person for each testimonial to add a human touch.
Ensure the homepage highlights the next session date and Early Bird offer prominently. For instance, keep the text “Next Session starts [Date] – only X seats left” and “Enroll before [Early Bird Deadline] to save $150” bold. These should be updated dynamically or easy to update.
Program Page (8-Week Program):
Revise the Weekly Schedule: Update Weeks 1–8 as per the new structure: include Accounts Receivable/Payable in Week 1 bullets; adjust Week 2 title to “Bank Reconciliation & Payroll Setup”; rename Week 3 to mention GST/BAS; Weeks 4–5 largely unchanged (just ensure titles and bullets match the content given above); Week 6 and 7 minor title tweaks (“End-of-Period Procedures” for week 7); Week 8 should be retitled to “Client Advisory & Emerging Tech (AI) + Capstone” (or similar) to reflect the integrated content.
Remove the separate “Bonus: AI & Cybersecurity” section entirely. Its content will be merged into Week 8, so take the bullet points from the bonus (AI tools, cybersecurity, data privacy, etc.) and integrate them as 2-3 bullets under Week 8.
After Week 8’s description, add a note like: “(The program includes emerging technology training to future-proof your skills.)” for clarity.
In the “Program Overview” at the top of the page, adjust any sentence that refers to the optional module. For example: “FACTS also includes an Introduction to AI and Cybersecurity as part of the curriculum, ensuring you gain awareness of emerging technologies...”.
Ensure the Apply Now buttons on this page still function after content moves. Keep a call-to-action at the end of the page (after the schedule and features) encouraging the user to apply or contact for questions.
Pricing Page:
In the list of what’s included for “Standard Enrollment”, change “AI & cybersecurity module” to “AI & Cybersecurity training integrated in course” (to reflect it’s part of the course, not an extra module).
Double-check that pricing (AUD $1,650 standard, $1,500 early bird) and dates (Early Bird deadline) are correct and update if needed. For example, if the early bird date has passed, set a new relevant date or adjust the messaging.
Simplify phrasing if needed: e.g., “If enrolled before April 30, 2025” can be updated to the next deadline or just “Enroll by [date] to get the Early Bird rate.”
The FAQ on this page is fine; just ensure consistency with the Contact page FAQ. If both pages have overlapping Q&A, consider keeping one source of truth (you could remove the duplicates on the contact page since we’re adding a FAQ section on homepage). If you keep FAQs on Pricing, add any important Q&As that were only on Contact (like course delivery or software access) so all common questions are answered.
About Page:
Update Darshan’s bio if needed to mention the incorporation of modern tech in training. For instance, in a section about the program’s evolution, add a line: “Darshan continuously updates the curriculum – recently adding AI and cybersecurity components – to keep the training relevant to current industry trends.” This just reinforces the innovation aspect.
If any new professional achievements or updates about Darshan or the program exist, include them. (Otherwise, the content here is solid and can remain largely unchanged.)
Contact Page:
Change the page title from “Contact Us” to “Enroll Now / Contact Us” to emphasize action. (And/or change the nav menu label “Book Now” to “Contact” or “Enroll” for clarity.)
Ensure the contact form works properly. After submission, it should show a success message. If possible, have the form send an email to fatrainingservice@gmail.com with the form details.
Add a sentence above the form like: “Interested in joining the next session? Have questions? Fill out the form and we’ll get in touch shortly.” to encourage users.
Since we added a FAQ section on the homepage, you can remove the FAQ from the contact page (to avoid redundancy). Instead, after the form, you can simply reiterate: “Check our FAQ above for common questions, or feel free to ask anything in your message.”
Make the phone number and email on this page clickable: e.g., <a href="tel:0449547715">0449 547 715</a> and <a href="mailto:fatrainingservice@gmail.com">fatrainingservice@gmail.com</a>. Also, add target="_blank" for the Instagram and Facebook links so they open new tabs.
Keep the business hours and maybe add timezone (AEST) if not stated, for completeness.
Design and Layout Enhancements:
Header & Navigation: Implement a mobile-friendly menu. For screen widths below, say, 768px, collapse the menu into a hamburger icon. The phone number in the header can remain visible on mobile (perhaps as a tap-to-call button). Ensure the logo “F.A.C.T.S” remains a home link and is clearly visible on all devices.
Imagery: Add at least 2 relevant stock photos: one for the homepage banner (as mentioned) and one possibly in the Program page (maybe a banner or side image of someone using accounting software). Use images of young professionals or students in an office or online meeting context to match the audience. All images should be optimized (use compressed JPG or WebP) and include descriptive alt tags.
Icons: Import a simple icon library or use SVG icons for visual accents. For example, next to “Industry expert instructor” put a graduation cap or user icon; next to “Practical software training” put a computer icon; next to “Job Placement Support” put a briefcase or handshake icon; next to “Future-Proof Skills (AI & Cybersecurity)” put a shield or AI brain icon. These should be subtle (maybe 24px size) and in the same color scheme as the site. This will make the bullet lists more visually engaging.
Color Scheme & Fonts: If not already defined, choose a consistent color scheme – for example, navy blue and orange (just an example). Use the primary color for headers and buttons, and a secondary color for accents or hover states. Ensure all text has high contrast against backgrounds (especially text over images or colored sections). Use a web-safe, professional font (the site likely uses something like Arial or a Google Font – verify and standardize across pages).
Buttons and Links: Style all buttons uniformly. The “Apply Now” and “Book Now” links should look like buttons (distinct background color, padding, rounded corners perhaps). On hover, they can slightly darken or show an outline. Also, add a “Get Started” or “Enroll Now” button on the homepage perhaps in the hero section to complement the text, similar to competitor’s “Join Now” button.
Section Layouts: Introduce colored background sections to break the page visually. For instance, the “Program Highlights” on homepage could have a light grey background box around it to stand out. The testimonial section could use a soft blue background. This differentiation makes scrolling more engaging. Use CSS to create these section backgrounds full-width.
Footer: Enhance the footer by adding the logo or site name, contact information (email/phone), and social media icons. You can include a phrase like “Empowering accounting graduates across Australia with job-ready skills.” as a tagline in the footer. Ensure the footer is visually separated (maybe with a dark background and light text) and sticks to the bottom of short pages. Also, include a link to the Privacy Policy or Terms if applicable (not provided, but a good practice placeholder).
Structural & Functional Improvements:
Add Testimonials Page (optional): Create a new page “Success Stories” (even if just to say “Coming soon: read about our graduates’ success.”) This is not urgent, but leaving a space for it in the nav or footer might be good. Alternatively, link the homepage testimonials to a full page if the quotes are long.
Social Proof Elements: On the homepage, below the main header or somewhere visible, add a line like “Over 50 graduates trained since 202X” (or whichever number is accurate). If the number is small (because it’s a newer program), you can omit it, but any metric (like “100% satisfaction rate” if you have survey data, or “10+ industry partners” if any) can help. This could be presented as a small horizontal stats section with maybe 3 stats. (Example: 🎓 50+ Graduates, 💼 Industry-Relevant Curriculum, ⭐ Excellent Feedback).
Ensure Responsiveness: Write media queries in CSS for common breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile) to adjust font sizes and section spacing. For mobile, make font sizes a bit larger for readability (e.g., body text 16px). Ensure images scale down (max-width:100%). The TikTok embed might need a wrapper div with a fixed aspect ratio for responsiveness; use TikTok’s guidelines or embed script which usually is responsive by default. Test the embedded video on mobile – if it overflows, you might need to set a max-width and height via CSS.
Accessibility: Add appropriate aria-labels for the navigation menu toggle, alt text for all images (including newly added icons if they’re not purely decorative), and ensure form fields have labels. This will improve accessibility. Also, if any link text is not descriptive (like “Learn More”), add aria-label to clarify (e.g., “Learn more about our accounting training program”).
Testing: After all changes, test each page thoroughly:
Click all nav links and buttons (they should scroll or navigate to the right place).
Submit the contact form test to see the success flow.
Check the countdown timer for the Early Bird offer (if it’s custom code, does it still work?).
Verify that integrating the AI content didn’t break the layout of the program page (sometimes long titles can overflow – if “Client Advisory & Emerging Tech” is too long for formatting, you can break it as “Client Advisory & \n Emerging Tech” on two lines or shorten it to “Client Advisory & AI Tools”).
Open the site on a smartphone or use device emulator to ensure no element is too large or misaligned.
Check that the TikTok video plays automatically on desktop (most browsers block sound on autoplay, hence why we mute it by default; the user can unmute if interested). On mobile, autoplay might not work (mobile browsers often block video autoplay to save data/battery), but at least the player should load and be one tap away from playing. That’s fine.
