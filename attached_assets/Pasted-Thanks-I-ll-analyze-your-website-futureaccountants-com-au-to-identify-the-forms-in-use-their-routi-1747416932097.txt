Thanks! I’ll analyze your website futureaccountants.com.au to identify the forms in use, their routing structure, the MP4 video being used, and how to integrate SendGrid email automation. I’ll also include support for sending a copy of each email to [fatrainingservice@gmail.com](mailto:fatrainingservice@gmail.com), and ensure the video autoplay works reliably across all devices.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a complete Replit AI prompt and implementation plan.


# Implementing Form Email Automation and Video Autoplay (Flask + SendGrid)

## Zoom Link Request Form (Fields & Route)

* The homepage includes a **"Get Zoom Link"** request form for the info session sign-up. It has a single field for the user’s email address (the page says *“Leave your email to get a Zoom link for our next free info session.”*).
* **HTML Fields:** an input (type="email") for the email address. This form should be wrapped in a `<form>` tag and use the POST method to send data to a Flask route. For example:

  ```html
  <form id="zoomForm" action="/zoom_link" method="POST">
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
      <button type="submit">Get Zoom Link</button>
  </form>
  ```

  Here the form’s `action` points to a Flask endpoint `/zoom_link` that will handle the submission.
* **Current behavior:** The site UI shows a field and a button for the Zoom link request, but it’s not clear if the form is currently wired up to a backend route (likely not, or it may just display a loading message). We will create a Flask route to handle this form’s POST data (the user’s email).

## Contact Form (Fields & Route)

* The **Contact Us** page contains a form with the following fields:

  * **Your Name**\* – text input (required)
  * **Email Address**\* – email input (required)
  * **Phone Number** – text or tel input (optional)
  * **Subject** – text input (optional)
  * **Message**\* – textarea (required)
  * **Interest Checkbox** – e.g. *“I’m interested in enrolling in the upcoming session”* (checkbox input)
    *(Fields marked with \* are required.)*
* These correspond to form inputs named (for example) `name`, `email`, `phone`, `subject`, `message`, and `interest`. The checkbox’s value can be checked by seeing if `request.form.get('interest')` is not `None` (it might return `"on"` if checked).
* The form should have a POST action pointing to a Flask route. Often, the contact form posts to the same `/contact` URL. For example:

  ```html
  <form id="contactForm" action="/contact" method="POST">
      <!-- form fields here -->
      <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
      <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email Address" required>
      <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone Number">
      <input type="text" name="subject" placeholder="Subject">
      <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="interest"> I’m interested in enrolling in the upcoming session
      </label><br>
      <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
  </form>
  ```
* **Current behavior:** This form’s front-end is present (with a "Send Message" button and even a “Loading…” indicator in the UI), but it needs a backend route to process the submission. We will use a Flask route (e.g. `/contact` with `methods=['POST']`) to handle the form data and send emails.

## Flask Backend: Adding Routes for Form Submissions

**Where to add the code:** In your Flask app file (e.g. `main.py` or `app.py` in Replit), define new routes or update existing ones to handle the form POST requests. Ensure you import `request` from Flask, and import the SendGrid client library. Also, load your SendGrid API key as an environment variable in Replit. (In Replit, you can add it under Secrets; e.g., `SENDGRID_API_KEY`.)

1. **Zoom Link Request Route** – Add a route to handle the Zoom link form submission. For example:

   ```python
   from flask import request, redirect, url_for, flash
   from sendgrid import SendGridAPIClient
   from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

   # ... (Flask app initialization above)

   @app.route('/zoom_link', methods=['POST'])
   def zoom_link():
       email = request.form.get('email')
       if email:
           # Compose confirmation email to the user
           message = Mail(
               from_email=('fatrainingservice@gmail.com', 'F.A.C.T.S Team'),
               to_emails=email,
               subject='Your Info Session Zoom Link',
               html_content=f"""
               <p>Hi there,</p>
               <p>Thank you for requesting the Zoom link for our free info session! We're excited to have you join us.</p>
               <p><strong>Zoom Meeting Details:</strong><br>
                  Date & Time: [Session Date/Time]<br>
                  Meeting Link: <a href="YOUR_ZOOM_MEETING_URL">Join Zoom Session</a><br>
                  Passcode: [if any]</p>
               <p>We look forward to seeing you! If you have any questions, just reply to this email.</p>
               <p>Best regards,<br>The F.A.C.T.S Team</p>
               """
           )
           # Add a BCC to send a copy to the team’s email
           message.add_bcc('fatrainingservice@gmail.com')
           try:
               sg = SendGridAPIClient(os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
               sg.send(message)  # send the email
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"SendGrid error: {e}")
       # Optionally, flash a success message
       # flash("Zoom link sent! Please check your email.")
       return redirect(url_for('home'))  # redirect back to homepage (adjust as needed)
   ```

   **Explanation:** This route grabs the submitted email from `request.form`. It then creates an email (using SendGrid’s `Mail` class) containing the Zoom meeting details (replace `"YOUR_ZOOM_MEETING_URL"` with your actual Zoom invite link or meeting ID). We set the `from_email` as your service’s address (ensure this is a verified sender in SendGrid). The email is addressed to the user’s email, and we use `add_bcc` to send a copy to **[fatrainingservice@gmail.com](mailto:fatrainingservice@gmail.com)** (your team’s address). Finally, we send the email via the SendGrid API client and redirect the user. You can also use `flash()` to show a success message on the site after redirect. (Make sure you’ve configured `home` route or adjust `url_for('home')` to wherever you want to redirect.)

2. **Contact Form Route** – Handle the contact form submissions. If your `/contact` page is already rendered via Flask, you can extend the same route to handle POST. For example:

   ```python
   @app.route('/contact', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
   def contact():
       if request.method == 'POST':
           # Get form fields
           name = request.form.get('name')
           email = request.form.get('email')
           phone = request.form.get('phone')
           subject = request.form.get('subject')
           message_text = request.form.get('message')
           interested = request.form.get('interest')  # checkbox (None if unchecked, "on" if checked)

           # Compose confirmation email to the user
           confirm_mail = Mail(
               from_email=('fatrainingservice@gmail.com', 'F.A.C.T.S Team'),
               to_emails=email,
               subject='Thanks for contacting F.A.C.T.S!',
               html_content=f"""
               <p>Hi {name or 'there'},</p>
               <p>Thank you for reaching out to Future Accountants Coaching & Training Service. We have received your message:</p>
               <blockquote>{message_text}</blockquote>

               <p>Sincerely,<br>The F.A.C.T.S Team</p>
               """
           )
           # BCC the team email to get a copy of the inquiry
           confirm_mail.add_bcc('fatrainingservice@gmail.com')
           try:
               sg = SendGridAPIClient(os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY'))
               sg.send(confirm_mail)
           except Exception as e:
               print(f"SendGrid error: {e}")
           # (Optional) you could also send a separate internal notification or save the data to a DB here.

           # Provide feedback to user and prevent form resubmission
           # flash("Your message has been sent! We'll be in touch soon.")
           return redirect(url_for('contact'))  # redirect back to contact page (GET)
       # If GET request, render the contact page template
       return render_template('contact.html')
   ```

   **Explanation:** On a GET request, this route simply renders the contact page. On POST (form submission), it collects all input fields from the form. Then it creates a thank-you email (`confirm_mail`) addressed to the user’s email, with a friendly message confirming receipt of their inquiry. The user’s message is included (quoted using `<blockquote>` for formatting), and if they checked the interest box, the email text adds a note that you’ll send enrollment details. We BCC your team’s email so that **[fatrainingservice@gmail.com](mailto:fatrainingservice@gmail.com)** also gets a copy of what the user submitted. The email is sent via SendGrid, similar to the Zoom link route. After sending, we redirect to the contact page (this clears the form and avoids duplicate submissions if the user refreshes). You can flash a success message to the user on that page load to confirm that their message was sent.

**Note:** Remember to install the SendGrid library and configure the API key:

* Add `sendgrid` to your `requirements.txt` or install it in the Replit package manager.
* Set the **SENDGRID\_API\_KEY** in the Replit Secrets (so `os.environ.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY')` returns it).
* Ensure the `from_email` you use (e.g. [fatrainingservice@gmail.com](mailto:fatrainingservice@gmail.com)) is verified in your SendGrid sender identities (SendGrid doesn’t allow arbitrary from addresses). If it’s not verified, use a verified sender or domain. The team’s address can still receive BCC copies. (If you want, you can add the user’s email as the Reply-To on the outgoing email for easy responses, but the above solution already sends the user a direct email and sends you a copy.)

## HTML5 Video Autoplay Setup (Mentor Video)

The home page’s **“Meet Your Mentor”** section uses an HTML5 video (with a poster image fallback). To ensure the video auto-plays across all platforms (desktop, Android, iOS), update the `<video>` element with the proper attributes and add a small JavaScript fallback. For example:

```html
<video id="mentorVideo" width="100%" autoplay muted playsinline loop 
       poster="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/mentor_thumbnail.jpg') }}">
    <source src="{{ url_for('static', filename='videos/mentor_intro.mp4') }}" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video>
```

**Important attributes:**

* **autoplay** – Tells the browser to start playing the video as soon as it can.
* **muted** – *Required for autoplay on modern browsers.* Muted videos are allowed to autoplay without user interaction (browsers block audio by default). By muting the video (assuming it’s just background/intro), it will play automatically.
* **playsinline** – Especially for iPhones/iOS Safari, this attribute is needed to allow the video to play inline (within the page) and to honor the autoplay setting. Without this, iOS might default to opening the video fullscreen and could block autoplay.
* **loop** – (Optional) Makes the video restart automatically when it ends. Use this if you want the video to play continuously.
* **poster** – A placeholder image to show before the video loads. You can use the mentor thumbnail (ensure the path is correct). This doesn’t affect autoplay but provides a nice fallback visual.

**Source Path:** In the example above, we use Flask’s `url_for` to reference `videos/mentor_intro.mp4` in the static folder. Make sure to put your actual video file in the `static/videos` directory of your Replit project (and adjust the filename if different). The template will serve it at the correct URL.

**JavaScript Fallback:** Despite using `autoplay` and `muted`, some mobile browsers might still require user interaction in certain cases. To cover this, you can add a small script to attempt playback once the page loads:

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const vid = document.getElementById('mentorVideo');
    if (vid) {
      vid.play().catch(err => {
        console.log('Autoplay might be blocked, user interaction is needed:', err);
      });
    }
  });
</script>
```

This script listens for the DOM to be ready, then tries `video.play()`. If the browser blocked autoplay, the promise `.catch` will log an error – indicating the user may need to tap to play. In most modern browsers with the above attributes, this won’t be necessary, but it’s a good fallback.

By adding the attributes and the inline script, the mentor video will **autoplay on desktop and mobile** (with no sound). Chrome and Android devices allow muted autoplay as of recent versions, and iOS Safari will allow it with the `playsinline` + `muted` combination. These changes do not alter the layout or appearance of the site – they only affect video behavior. The video will remain visually in the same place with the same dimensions; it will just start playing automatically and loop silently in the background as intended.

## Conclusion

You now have a complete setup where:

* The **Zoom link request form** on the homepage submits to a Flask route and triggers an immediate email to the user with the Zoom meeting link (and CC/BCC to your team).
* The **Contact form** sends a confirmation email to the user (and a copy to your team) so inquiries are acknowledged promptly.
* Both forms are handled via Flask backend routes using SendGrid for reliable email delivery.
* The **embedded video** is configured to autoplay consistently across browsers by using `autoplay`, `muted`, `playsinline`, and a fallback script.

Place the Flask route code in your application (below your existing routes) and update the HTML as shown. With these changes, your website’s functionality will be enhanced for better user engagement, all while keeping the design and layout unchanged. Copy the above instructions into Replit’s workspace or AI prompt to implement them step-by-step in your project. Good luck with your F.A.C.T.S site launch!
