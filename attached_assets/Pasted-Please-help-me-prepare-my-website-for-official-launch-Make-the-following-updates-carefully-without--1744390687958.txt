Please help me prepare my website for official launch. Make the following updates carefully without deleting any important logic or breaking structure:

✅ FUNCTIONALITY & UI FIXES
1. Fix the countdown timer so it accurately counts down to April 30, 2025. If the script is broken or missing, write a new working version in vanilla JavaScript.
2. After a user submits the contact form, show an inline message saying "Thanks! We'll contact you shortly." Don't redirect or reload the page.
3. Convert the desktop navigation menu into a hamburger-style collapsible menu on smaller screens (mobile responsive).
4. Highlight the currently active page in the top navigation bar using an `active` class (based on current route or URL).
5. Temporarily hide the Blog menu item from the navbar, or if easier, make the blog page show a simple “Coming Soon” message.

✅ ADMIN DASHBOARD CHANGES
6. Clear all previously stored analytics and chart data. This is a fresh launch — do not use any mock data. Set the system to begin tracking real user activity and charting that moving forward.
7. Make the "Daily", "Weekly", and "Monthly" chart filter buttons functional — when clicked, reload real analytics data based on that time frame.
8. Reinstate the admin login system: reactivate `@login_required` decorators and ensure users must log in to access any `/admin` routes.
9. Add client-side search functionality to any long tables in the admin portal (e.g., visitor logs, button clicks, page views).
10. Make sure admin dashboard charts (labels and tooltips) are readable and responsive on mobile and small screen sizes.

✅ SEO & PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
11. Add a `<meta name="description">` and appropriate Open Graph meta tags to the `<head>` of the homepage and the About page (title, description, image, etc.).
12. Create a `robots.txt` file that disallows `/admin` and allows all public-facing pages to be crawled by search engines.
13. Add `loading="lazy"` to all `<img>` tags across the site. Compress any large images if file sizes are unnecessarily large.
14. Confirm the website is fully responsive: test key pages on mobile and tablet sizes using CSS media queries. Fix layout issues where needed.

❗IMPORTANT:
- Do not use placeholder or mock data — set up real data tracking starting now.
- Leave clear comments in the code next to every change you make so I can review them later.
- DO NOT delete or permanently disable the authentication system. Simply reinstate it for admin access as it was before.

This is a production prep task, so all changes must be stable, scalable, and clean.
