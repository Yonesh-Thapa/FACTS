SEO Improvements: Add unique meta descriptions to each page (Home, About, Program, Pricing) reflecting their content. Ensure all images have descriptive alt text. Add a <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> to the head for mobile. Include an XML sitemap and robots.txt if not present.
Accessibility Fixes: Add <label> elements for form inputs (e.g., admin login fields, email signup). Make the phone number a clickable link (<a href="tel:0449547715">). Ensure color contrast meets WCAG standards (adjust colors if needed). Add aria-label or screen-reader text for any icon-only links (e.g., social media). Enable keyboard navigation for the menu (add focus styles, ensure the “Book Now” menu can be accessed via keyboard).
Code Cleanup: Remove any duplicate or unnecessary HTML (e.g., the phone number appears twice in nav – remove the redundant instance). Eliminate inline styles and move them to static/css/style.css. Delete unused CSS selectors (audit the CSS file for rules not applied in the HTML). Minify CSS/JS assets for faster loads. If multiple CSS/JS files exist, combine where possible. Ensure consistent HTML structure (proper use of header, nav, main, footer tags). Remove placeholder code (such as the empty “Follow Us” list) or replace it with actual content (add social links if available).
Countdown Timer Fix: Update the countdown JavaScript so that it always displays all time units even when they are zero. Stop hiding the “0d/0h/0m” values to prevent flicker. For example, if the code currently does if(hours == 0) { hide hours }, change it to always show “0h”. Test the countdown on the Pricing and Home pages to confirm that when a value hits zero it stays visible (no disappearing/reappearing). Ensure the countdown stops at 0 and possibly display a message like “Offer expired” after the deadline passes.
Content Updates (About Page): Insert new sections into about.html (or the appropriate template):
Our Mission: “F.A.C.T.S is dedicated to empowering aspiring accountants by bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world practice. We provide practical, job-ready training and mentorship, enabling our students to confidently launch and grow their accounting careers.”
Our Vision: “To build a future where every accounting graduate enters the workforce with confidence, practical experience, and a professional network. We envision F.A.C.T.S as a leading platform that produces skilled accountants and fosters a community of continuous learning and career advancement.”
What We Stand For: Add a list of values (Practical Learning, Mentorship & Personal Attention, Integrity & Professionalism, Innovation & Future-Readiness, Student Success) with brief descriptions (as outlined in the plan above). Use proper HTML list markup for these.
About the Tutor: Create a new section highlighting Darshan Kumar Thapa’s bio. Include his credentials (CPA ASA, MPAS, Xero Certified) and a summary of his experience and teaching approach. You can use the content written in the plan (condense if needed) and format it with a combination of paragraph and bullet points for key qualifications. Remove or rewrite any redundant info that was previously under “Our Mission” or elsewhere so that Darshan’s info is only in this section. Use a heading like <h2>About the Tutor</h2> for this section, and ensure it’s linked in the page’s table of contents if there is one.
Keep the existing “Why Choose F.A.C.T.S” and “Our Story” sections, but ensure their placement flows logically (perhaps Mission/Vision/Values first, then Why Choose, Our Story, then Tutor). Adjust navigation or on-page links if any to these new sections.
Functional Checks: Verify that the “Apply Now / Book Now” buttons link to the correct place. If there is a specific enrollment page or form, update the href. If not, temporarily use a mailto: link or create a simple contact form page and point to it. Similarly, test the “Get Zoom Link” email form – if it’s not functional, implement a basic form handling (even if it just sends an email to fatrainingservice@gmail.com or saves to a list). Ensure a success message is shown after form submission so users know it worked.
Color Scheme Update: In the CSS, define a clear set of color variables for the site’s palette. For example, choose a primary color (e.g., navy #002d5c) and an accent (e.g., orange #f39c12) as discussed. Update the stylesheet to use these colors for headers, footers, buttons, links, etc. (e.g., nav background, button backgrounds, link hovers). Remove any inconsistent color codes leftover from before. After changes, check every page to confirm the text is easily readable (adjust light/dark of colors as needed for contrast). The goal is a modern, cohesive look – ensure the primary color is used consistently for branding elements and the accent draws attention to calls-to-action.
Implement all the above changes and then thoroughly test the site across pages and devices. The end result should be a faster, cleaner website with a clear message (Mission/Vision), no visual glitches, an attractive color scheme, and an easy path for users to get in touch or enroll. Good luck with the updates!
