                    <p>F.A.C.T.S was founded by Darshan Kumar Thapa after recognizing a significant gap in the Australian accounting education system. While many graduates leave university with strong theoretical knowledge, they often lack the practical, software-based skills that employers seek in entry-level accountants.</p>
                    
                    <p>Drawing on his experience as both a certified accountant and educator, Darshan developed a comprehensive 5-week program specifically designed to bridge this gap and help recent graduates secure their first accounting roles.</p>
                    
                    <p>With his extensive background in public practice accounting, cloud accounting solutions, tax compliance, and client advisory services, Darshan brings real-world expertise directly to his students. His approachable teaching style and passion for mentoring have made him highly regarded among graduates seeking to enhance their employability in Australia's competitive accounting job market.</p>
                    
                    <p>Darshan personally guides each cohort through the entire 5-week program, providing hands-on instruction and mentorship. His teaching philosophy emphasizes practical skills that directly translate to workplace success, ensuring students not only understand accounting concepts but can apply them effectively in professional settings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since its founding, F.A.C.T.S has helped numerous accounting graduates across Australia transition successfully into the workforce by providing them with the practical skills, confidence, and job-seeking strategies they need to stand out in a competitive job market.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our approach combines technical training with career development, ensuring that our graduates are not only proficient in industry-standard accounting software but also prepared to navigate the job search process effectively.</p>
