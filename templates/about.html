                    <p>F.A.C.T.S was founded by Darshan Kumar Thapa after recognizing a significant gap in the Australian accounting education system. While many graduates leave university with strong theoretical knowledge, they often lack the practical, software-based skills that employers seek in entry-level accountants.</p>
                    
                    <p>Drawing on his experience as both a certified accountant and educator, Darshan developed a comprehensive 5-week program specifically designed to bridge this gap and help recent graduates secure their first accounting roles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since its founding, F.A.C.T.S has helped numerous accounting graduates across Australia transition successfully into the workforce by providing them with the practical skills, confidence, and job-seeking strategies they need to stand out in a competitive job market.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our approach combines technical training with career development, ensuring that our graduates are not only proficient in industry-standard accounting software but also prepared to navigate the job search process effectively.</p>
