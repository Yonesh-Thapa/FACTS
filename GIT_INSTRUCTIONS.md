# Git Push Instructions for FACTS Project

Since Replit restricts direct Git operations, you'll need to push to GitHub manually. Here are the steps:

## Option 1: Download and Push Manually

1. **Download the project**:
   - In Replit, go to the three dots menu (â‹®) and select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your local machine

2. **Set up local repository**:
   ```bash
   cd FACTS-project-folder
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - F.A.C.T.S accounting training platform"
   git remote add origin git@github.com:Yonesh-Thapa/FACTS.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Use Replit's GitHub Integration

1. Go to the Replit sidebar and click on "Version Control" 
2. Click "Create a Git repository"
3. Then click "Connect to GitHub"
4. Select your repository: `Yonesh-Thapa/FACTS`

## Option 3: Use Replit Shell (if Git operations work)

If the restrictions are lifted, you can try these commands in the Shell:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - F.A.C.T.S accounting training platform"
git remote add origin git@github.com:Yonesh-Thapa/FACTS.git
git push -u origin main
```
